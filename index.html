    <h2>About Me</h2>
    My name is Nathalia Rogacheski, and I'm originally from Curitiba, Brazil. I'm currently 23 years old and furthering my education at the University of Florida in Public Relations. A fun fact about me is that I have lived in six cities and a total of ten houses!
    <h3>Hobbies</h3> 
    I enjoy a diverse range of activities, including:
    *Shopping
    *Snowboarding
    *Disney days
    *Going to the beach
    *& eating all types of chocolate
    I have lived in various climates, including the northern part of Michigan. The city I spent the most time was Charlevoix, Michigan. It is a tiny town with little to do, so I took on skiing. It was my favorite activity; now, as I'm older, a few years back, I wanted a new challenge: snowboarding. This year my boyfriend and I will be taking our snowboard adventures to the Stowe Mountains in Vermont; take a look at those impressive slopes here.
    <h3>Interests</h3>  
    My number 1 interest is challenging myself, stretching from getting a Master's to learning how to drive a forklift.  
    I also love learning about skincare andd beauty regimes as I want to look 20 when I'm 40.
    Overall, my daily goal and what I strive for is to be better than I was yesterday. 
    <h3>Career Goals</h3>  
    My long-term career goal is to be my own boss. I hope to take in as much knowledge as possible in the coming years. Being a woman obsessed with skincare and makeup, I would love a communication position in a beauty company where my knowledge and passion overlap and every day is a new adventure.
